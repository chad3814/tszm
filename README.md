## Features

- Abstractable input/output permitting the engine to be used in a variety of environments (console, web, others)
- Support for the upcoming ZMCDN AI/LLM based enhancements for Interactive Fiction
- Compatibility with z1-z6

## Current Status
3-Oct-2025: Leather Goddesses is playable, some jankiness is expected, but focus is now shifting to ZMCDN which will add Sixel graphics output to the tszm.ts terminal output.
