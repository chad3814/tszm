# TSZM

> TypeScript-based Inform/Z-Machine interpreter

## Features

- Abstractable input/output permitting the engine to be used in a variety of environments (console, web, others)
- Support for the upcoming ZMCDN AI/LLM based enhancements for Interactive Fiction
- Compatibility with z1-z6 (except text-windowing, graphics, sound)

## Current Status
04-Oct-2025: Many compatibility fixes have been made, most games are playable. I'm currently drawing the line at text "window", graphics, and sound functionality, meaning just about all the .z3s are fine.
